Credit Risk Analysis Report

An Overview of the Analysis: 

Credit Risk is associated with a borrower not returning an asset or paying a loan back causing a lender to lose money. In this analysis we used Machine Learning to analyze the dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers. We used various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. The following steps were used to come to a final conclusion: split the Data into training and testing sets, create a logistic regression model with the original data, predict a logistic regression model with resampled training data, and trite a credit risk analysis report.

Using a machine learning model, I tried to determine which loans are healthy loans or high-risk loans based on the loan status provided by the lending company.

The Results: Using a bulleted list, describe the accuracy score, the precision score, and recall score of the machine learning model.

- The accuracy for the Imbalanced data model was 95% (could be improved due to the data being imbalanced)
- The accuracy for the OverSampled data model was 99%
- This means the OverSampled data model was a more guareented model when analysing data for this project.

-The precision score for the Imbalanced data model was 100% precise for healthy loan and 85% precise for high-risk loan when making predictions.
-The precision score for the OverSampled data model was 100% precise for healthy loan and 84% precise for high-risk loan when makeing predictions.


A Summary:

A lending company might want a model that requires classifying healthy loans and high-risk loans correctly most of the time. 

The Logistic Regression model with the OverSampled data performed better at 99% than the model with the Imbalanced data at 95% accuracy. 

Logistic Regession Model 2 is less likely to predict false negative results. However, based on the confusion matrices for each model, Logistic Regession Model 2 predicted more false positives (healthy when actual was high-risk).

Logistic Regession Model 2 has fewer false predicitions of the data overall and would be the best model to use based on the higher accuracy score as well.
