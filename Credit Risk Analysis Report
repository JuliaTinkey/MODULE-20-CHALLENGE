Credit Risk Analysis Report

An overview of the analysis: 

Credit Risk is associated with a borrower not returning an asset or paying a loan back causing a lender to lose money. In this analysis we used Machine Learning to analyze the dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers. We used various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. The following steps were used to come to a final conclusion: split the Data into training and testing sets, create a logistic regression model with the original data, predict a logistic regression model with resampled training data, and trite a credit risk analysis report.

Using a machine learning model, I tried to determine which loans are healthy loans or high-risk loans based on the loan status provided by the lending company.

The results: Using a bulleted list, describe the accuracy score, the precision score, and recall score of the machine learning model.



A Summary:

A lending company might want a model that requires classifying healthy loans and high-risk loans correctly most of the time. Healthy loans being identified as a high-risk loan might be more costly for a lending company since it might cause the loss of customers. High-risk loans being identified as a healthy loan might also be more costly for a lending company due to the loss of funds being provided by the lender.

The Logistic Regression model with the OverSampled data performed better at 99% than the model with the Imbalanced data at 95% accuracy. 

I would recommend using the Logistic Regression Model with OverSampled Data since the accuracy score was higher as well as the data in the confion matrics.
